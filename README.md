# BeatBurst-GameJam
This is a personal challenge made with Manon Bletard. Our goal was to do an Improvised GameJam on a random theme in less than 5 days while continuing our professional, school and social lives.

Our theme was: Break Everything, and we wanted to challenge ourselves by combining the rhythmic side.

Manon Bletard (https://www.artstation.com/manonbletard)  took care of all the graphics, while I took care of GameDesign, Game Programming, etc...
We used the music: "LaserPointer- Wontolla" and the font for the text: "Chinese Rocks - Typodermic Fonts.
Character animations were made on mixamo.
